FileHandle/Rollback version 1.05
========================

NAME
    FileHandle::Rollback - FileHandle with commit, rollback, and journaled
    crash recovery

SYNOPSIS
      use FileHandle::Rollback;
      my ($fh);
  
      # open file handle
      $fh = FileHandle::Rollback->new("+< $path")
        or die "cannot open filehandle: $!";
  
      # put some data at a specific address
      $fh->seek(80, 0);
      print $fh '1500';
  
      # read some data, partially including data 
      # that was written in this rollback segment
      $fh->seek(70, 0);
      $fh->read($data, 100);
  
      # if you want to cancel the changes:
      $fh->rollback;
  
      # or, if you want save the changes:
      $fh->commit;

INSTALLATION
    FileHandle::Rollback can be installed with the usual routine:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    You can also just copy Rollback.pm into the FileHandle/ directory of one
    of your library trees.

DESCRIPTION
    FileHandle::Rollback allows you to open a filehandle, write data to that
    handle, read the data back exactly as if it were already in the file,
    then cancel the whole transaction if you choose. FileHandle::Rollback
    works like FileHandle, with a few important differences, most notably
    the addition of "rollback()" and "commit()". Those additions and
    differences are noted below.

  $fh->rollback()

    Cancels all changes since the last rollback, commit, or since you opened
    the file handle.

  $fh->commit()

    Writes changes to the file.

  $fh->flock($mode)

    The flock method locks the file like the built-in flock command. Use the
    same mode arguments: "LOCK_SH", "LOCK_EX", and "LOCK_UN".

      use Fcntl ':flock';
  
      unless ($fh->flock(LOCK_EX))
        {die "cannot lock filehandle: $!"}

  binmode

    FileHandle::Rollback only works in binmode, so it will automatically put
    itself into binmode.

  read/write

    FileHandle::Rollback only works in read/write mode. Regardless of what
    you begin the file path with (+<, +>, >, >>, etc) FileHandle::Rollback
    opens the file with +< . However, if > is anywhere in the path then
    FileHandle::Rollback will create the file if it doesn't already exist.

  autmatic crash recovery

    This feature journals the data being written to your file so that if
    there is a server crash while the data is being written,
    FileHandle::Rollback automatically finishes the data write. In short,
    crash recovery protects you against invalid data formats: either all the
    data is written or none of it is.

    To implement crash recovery, simply add the "journal" option to the
    "new" command. "journal" consists of an anonymous array containing two
    elements:

     $fh = FileHandle::Rollback->new('members.db', journal=>['members.journal', 'members.sem'])
        or die $!;

    The first element is the file name of a "journal" file, a file where
    data is temporarily stored before being written to the real data file.
    The second element is the file name of a "semaphore" file whose
    existence indicates that data is being written to the data file.

    When a FileHandle::Rollback object is created with journaling, the first
    thing it does is check if the semaphore file exists. If that file does
    exist, then the object knows that there was a crash the last time the
    data was being written. The object pulls the stored data from the
    journal file and tries again to write the data to the data file. Once
    the data is fully written, it deletes the semaphore and journal files.

    This form of crash recovery is dependent on the atomicity of file
    creation and deletion on your computer, so on some systems (particularly
    NFS) there is a small chance that crash recovery will not work properly.

    A lot of the code in this module was copied from MemHandle.pm by
    Sheridan C. Rawlins. In fact, I started with Sheridan's module and just
    changed code until it worked the way I wanted, so Sheridan gets a lot of
    credit for FileHandle::Rollback.
