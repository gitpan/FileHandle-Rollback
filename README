FileHandle/Rollback version 1.04
========================

NAME
    FileHandle::Rollback - FileHandle with commit and rollback

SYNOPSIS
      use FileHandle::Rollback;
      my ($fh);
  
      # open file handle
      $fh = FileHandle::Rollback->new("+< $path")
        or die "cannot open filehandle: $!";
  
      # put some data at a specific address
      $fh->seek(80, 0);
      print $fh '1500';
  
      # read some data, partially including data 
      # that was written in this rollback segment
      $fh->seek(70, 0);
      $fh->read($data, 100);
  
      # if you want to cancel the changes:
      $fh->rollback;
  
      # or, if you want save the changes:
      $fh->commit;

INSTALLATION
    FileHandle::Rollback can be installed with the usual routine:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    You can also just copy Rollback.pm into the FileHandle/ directory of one
    of your library trees.

DESCRIPTION
    FileHandle::Rollback allows you to open a filehandle, write data to that
    handle, read the data back exactly as if it were already in the file,
    then cancel the whole transaction if you choose. FileHandle::Rollback
    works like FileHandle, with a few important differences, most notably
    the addition of "rollback()" and "commit()". Those additions and
    differences are noted below.

  $fh->rollback()

    Cancels all changes since the last rollback, commit, or since you opened
    the file handle.

  $fh->commit()

    Writes changes to the file.

  $fh->flock($mode)

    The flock method locks the file like the built-in flock command. Use the
    same mode arguments: "LOCK_SH", "LOCK_EX", and "LOCK_UN".

      use Fcntl ':flock';
  
      unless ($fh->flock(LOCK_EX))
        {die "cannot lock filehandle: $!"}

  binmode

    FileHandle::Rollback only works in binmode, so it will automatically put
    itself into binmode.

  read/write

    FileHandle::Rollback only works in read/write mode. Regardless of what
    you begin the file path with (+<, +>, >, >>, etc) FileHandle::Rollback
    opens the file with +< . However, if > is anywhere in the path then
    FileHandle::Rollback will create the file if it doesn't already exist.

    A lot of the code in this module was copied from MemHandle.pm by
    Sheridan C. Rawlins. In fact, I started with Sheridan's module and just
    changed code until it worked the way I wanted, so Sheridan gets a lot of
    credit for FileHandle::Rollback.
